# About

<p>I'm a São Paulo-based software developer focused on web projects. Currently, I work at Grupo Cerebral building a learning platform that can offer a better, more modern experience to students.</p>

<p>I graduated in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of São Paulo. During my undergrad years, I spent one year as an exchange student in University of Toronto.</p>

<p>Lately, I'm working with (and studying) JavaScript, NodeJS and React.</p>

<p>I'm really interested in accessibility, best practices for UI/UX and DevOps.</p>
